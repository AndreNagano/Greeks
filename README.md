# The Greeks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook giving an introduction to the Greeks, measures of volatility of an option. It goes through all the five Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho), calculating their formulas by partially deriving the Black-Scholes Formula.

I recommend checking out my Black-Scholes repository, in case you're not familiar with the topic.
