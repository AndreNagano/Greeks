    "\n",
    "$$C = S\\Phi(d_1) - e^{-r(T-t)}K\\Phi (d_2)  = (what\\ we\\ expect\\ to\\ receive) - (what\\ we\\ expect\\ to\\ pay)$$\n",

    "This means that the second component is what we expect to pay. If the $e^{-r(T-t)}K$ represents the present value of strike price, the $\\Phi(d_2)$ represents the probability of paying this amount or the probability of exercising this option. When we exercise the option, or when $S_T > K$, we say that the option expires in-the-money. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\Phi(d_2)$ probability is not exactly equal to Delta ($\\Phi(d_1)$). However, depending on the value of $\\sigma$ and $T$, it is close enough to be used as a proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta Hedging\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delta is also used for Delta hedging or creating a Delta-neutral portfolio. A Delta-neutral portfolio is one where the sum of all Deltas is zero. This means that its value won't change if the stock price makes a small move up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take for example a portfolio where we sell 1 call option contract, representing 100 shares. We're selling a contract that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation of buying 100 stocks by a certain strike price. Let's also assume that the shorted call option has a Delta of 0.60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're shorting the call option, our Delta would be negative as $-0.60 \\times 100\\ shares = -60$. So, if the stock price rises by \\$1, the option's price will increase by \\$0.60 per share and we lose \\$60.\n",
    "\n",
    "To neutralize the -60 Delta, we have to make a position with +60 Delta. The underlying stock has a Delta of 1. Therefore, we can just buy 60 shares of the underlying stock to neutralize the negative Delta position, resulting in a Delta-neutral portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gamma\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gamma measures the rate of change between the option's Delta and the underlying asset's price. In other words, the Gamma is the second-order partial derivative of the option's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 C(S, t)}{\\partial S^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta}{\\partial S} = \\frac{\\partial \\Phi(d_1)}{\\partial S}$$\n",

    "$$\\Gamma = \\frac{\\Phi' (d_1)}{S \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate the second-order partial derivative of the Black-Scholes formula for a put option, we find the same results, which means that the formula above is valid for both call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Hedging\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen in the last topic, the Delta can be used to create Delta-neutral portfolios. However, the Delta is not constant over time, it can change as the underlying asset's price moves. Since the Gamma measures the rate of change in Delta, we can use it to calculate how many shares we should buy or sell to maintain a Delta-neutral position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with the example from the topic on Delta Hedging. The current portfolio has a Delta of 0, since we shorted the call option and bought 60 shares of the underlying stock. Assuming a Gamma of 0.40, means that an increase of \\$1 in the underlying stock price increases the Delta by 0.04. Therefore, the new Delta will be $0.60+0.04=0.64$ per share, and the new Delta for the portfolio will be $-0.64\\times 100 = -64$. In order to neutralize the Delta, we should buy 4 shares of the underlying stock.\n",

    "## Theta\n",

    "Options become more valuable as volatility increases. Options provide the potential of unlimited profit but a strictly limited loss. So, as volatility increases, a huge upward swing could lead to massive profits. While, a huge downward swing wouldn't make much difference, since the loss is capped.\n",

    "One trading strategy would be to buy options with high Vega when we expect the volatility to increase. The opposite is also viable, shorting options with high Vega when we expect the volatility to decrease.\n",
